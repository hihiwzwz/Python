After little Jim learned Fibonacci Number in the class , he was very interest in it.<br>Now he is thinking about a new thing -- Fibonacci String .<br><br>He defines : str[n] = str[n-1] + str[n-2] ( n &gt; 1 ) <br><br>He is so crazying that if someone gives him two strings str[0] and str[1], he will calculate the str[2],str[3],str[4] , str[5].... <br><br>For example :<br>If str[0] = &quot;ab&quot;; str[1] = &quot;bc&quot;;<br>he will get the result , str[2]=&quot;abbc&quot;, str[3]=&quot;bcabbc&quot; , str[4]=&quot;abbcbcabbc&quot; …………;<br><br>As the string is too long ,Jim can't write down all the strings in paper. So he just want to know how many times each letter appears in Kth Fibonacci String . Can you help him ?<br>

The first line contains a integer N which indicates the number of test cases.<br>Then N cases follow.<br>In each case,there are two strings str[0], str[1] and a integer K (0 &lt;= K &lt; 50) which are separated by a blank.<br>The string in the input will only contains less than 30 low-case letters.<br>

For each case,you should count how many times each letter appears in the Kth Fibonacci String and print out them in the format &quot;X:N&quot;. <br>If you still have some questions, look the sample output carefully.<br>Please output a blank line after each test case.<br><br>To make the problem easier, you can assume the result will in the range of int. <br>

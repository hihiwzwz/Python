Given a positive integer $N$, you should output the most right digit of $N^N$.

The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer $T$ which is the number of test cases. $T$ test cases follow.

Each test case contains a single positive integer $N(1 \leq N \leq 1,000,000,000)$.

For each test case, you should output the rightmost digit of $N^N$.

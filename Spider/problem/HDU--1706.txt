The graph diameter is the length of the &quot;longest shortest path&quot; between any two vertices of a graph. In other words, a graph's diameter is the longest path which must be traversed in order to travel from any vertex to another when paths which backtrack, detour, or loop are excluded from consideration.<br> Given an undirected graph, your mission is to count the number of diameters of it.

The input contains multiple test cases.  <br>For each test case, it contains n+1 lines. <br>Line 1: two integers m, n (2&lt;= m &lt;= 100, 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 4000) indicating that there are m vertices and n edges in the city. <br>Line 2~n+1: each contains three integers i, j, d (1 &lt;= i, j &lt;= m, 1 &lt;= d &lt;= 100), indicating that there is an edge of length d connecting vertex i and vertex j. 

Output the value of the diameter and the number of diameters in a single line, separated by a single space.

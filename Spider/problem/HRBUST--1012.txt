		Farmer John has been informed of the location of a fugitive cow and wants to catch her immediately. He starts at a point <i>N</i> (0 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100,000) on a number line and the cow is at a point <i>K</i> (0 &le; <i>K</i> &le; 100,000) on the same number line. Farmer John has two modes of transportation: walking and teleporting.</p>
	<p>
		* Walking: FJ can move from any point <i>X</i> to the points <i>X </i>- 1 or <i>X </i>+ 1 in a single minute<br />
		* Teleporting: FJ can move from any point <i>X</i> to the point 2 &times; <i>X</i> in a single minute.</p>
	<p>
		If the cow, unaware of its pursuit, does not move at all, how long does it take for Farmer John to retrieve it?</p>

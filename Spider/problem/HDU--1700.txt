There is a cycle with its center on the origin.<br>Now give you a point on the cycle, you are to find out the other two points on it, to maximize the sum of the distance between each other<br>you may assume that the radius of the cycle will not exceed 1000.

There are T test cases, in each case there are 2 decimal number representing the coordinate of the given point.

For each testcase you are supposed to output the coordinates of both of the unknow points by 3 decimal places of precision <br>Alway output the lower one first(with a smaller Y-coordinate value), if they have the same Y value output the one with a smaller X. <br><br><div style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px'><div style='font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed'><i>NOTE</i></div>when output, if the absolute difference between the coordinate values X1 and X2 is smaller than 0.0005, we assume they are equal.</div>

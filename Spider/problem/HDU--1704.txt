there are N ACMers in HDU team.<br>  ZJPCPC Sunny Cup 2007 is coming, and lcy want to select some excellent ACMers to attend the contest. There have been M matches since the last few days(No two ACMers will meet each other at two matches, means between two ACMers there will be at most one match). lcy also asks&quot;Who is the winner between A and B?&quot; But sometimes you can't answer lcy's query, for example, there are 3 people, named A, B, C.and 1 match was held between A and B, in the match A is the winner, then if lcy asks &quot;Who is the winner between A and B&quot;, of course you can answer &quot;A&quot;, but if lcy ask &quot;Who is the winner between A and C&quot;, you can't tell him the answer.<br> As lcy's assistant, you want to know how many queries at most you can't tell lcy(ask A B, and ask B A is the same; and lcy won't ask the same question twice).

The input contains multiple test cases.<br>The first line has one integer,represent the number of test cases.<br>Each case first contains two integers N and M(N , M &lt;= 500), N is the number of ACMers in HDU team, and M is the number of matchs have been held.The following M lines, each line means a match and it contains two integers A and B, means A wins the match between A and B.And we define that if A wins B, and B wins C, then A wins C.

For each test case, output a integer which represent the max possible number of queries that you can't tell lcy.

<p>Granny is preparing moonshine whiskey for an upcoming family reunion.  Because her family is large, she needs to make several batches of whiskey, which she collects in a large metal cream can.  After making, and sampling, several batches Granny  stumbles and knocks the can on its side.  Fortunately, the lid is tightly fixed so no whiskey is lost.</p>
<p>Our question to you is this:  assuming that the depth of whiskey in the can was <i>k</i> cm with the can sitting upright, what is its depth with the can lying horizontal?  The can itself is made of two cylinders:  the body with height <i>h<sub>b</sub></i> and diameter <i>d<sub>b</sub></i>, and the neck with  height <i>h<sub>n</sub></i> and diameter <i>d<sub>n</sub></i>.  The neck and body are joined by a tapered conic shoulder such that the overall height of the can is <i>h</i>.  The bottom and lid of the can are disks of diameter <i>d<sub>b</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>n</sub></i> respectively.</p>
<p>Input consists of several test cases.  Each test case consists of a line containing real numbers <i>k h<sub>b</sub> d<sub>b</sub> h<sub>n</sub> d<sub>n</sub></i> and <i>h.</i>  You may assume that <i>100&nbsp;≥&nbsp;h&nbsp;≥&nbsp;h<sub>b</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;h<sub>n</sub></i> and that <i>100&nbsp;≥&nbsp;d<sub>b</sub>&nbsp;≥&nbsp;d<sub>n</sub></i>.   A line containing 0 0 0 0 0 0 follows the last test case.</p>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing <i>s</i> the depth with the can lying horizontally, rounded to two decimal places.</p>

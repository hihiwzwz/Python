Now is spring ! The sunshine is warm , the flowers is coming out . How lovely it is! So my classmates and I want to go out for a spring-outing.<br><br>But we all select courses ourselves. We don't have classes at the same time.Now our monitor has a big trouble in arranging the time of the spring-outing.<br><br>Can you help him?<br><br>I will give you our courses information and the time of the spring-outing.You just need to tell me that who can't go with us. <br>

The first line contains an integer CA which indicates the number of test cases.<br>Then CA cases follow.<br>Each case contains two parts,the students' courses information and the query.<br><br>In the first part ,first there is an integer N（N&lt;200） which means the number of the student,and then comes the N students’ courses information.<br>A student's courses information is in this format:<br><br>line1:   name K<br>line2:   day1 b1 e1<br>.....<br>lineK+1: dayK bK eK<br><br>The first line of a student's courses infomation contains his name(less than 20 characters and in lowercase) and the number(K,K&lt;1000) of his courses . Then next K lines describe his courses. Each Line contain three integers indicate the day of a week( 1 &lt;= day &lt;= 7 means Monday to Sunday ), the begin time and the end time of the course.<br>To make the problem easier,the begin time and the end time will be in the range from 1 to 11 .(Because in HDU,there is 11 classes one day).<br><br>In the query part , first there is an integer Q which means the query number,and then Q lines follow.<br>A query contains three integers which means the day ,the begin time and the end time of the spring-outing.And the time is described as the courses.<br>Notice,everyone may have more than one course at the same time for some special reasons.<br>

For each query , just print the names of the students who can't go out for a spring-outing in a line in lexicographic order.<br>Please separate two names with a blank.<br>If all of the students have time to go , just print &quot;None&quot; in a line.<br>
